This is a simple static webserver with a GUI frontend to start and stop it. It is useful if you have a static website to share with your customer and he or she does not have a webserver at hand. Just create a zip, with Go Fyne Webserver in the root directory. Create a static folder which contains your static website. Run the binary and you will see
a window.
