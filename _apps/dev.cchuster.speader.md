Modeled after the proprietary Word Runner feature offered by Amazon Kindle, Speader displays text one or multiple words at a time with varying paces to increase reading speed and efficiency. Speader can display up to 1500 words per minute in groups of up to 15 words. Text can be copy and pasted into a text box or uploaded as a file.
