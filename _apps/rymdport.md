Rymdport (formerly wormhole-gui) is a cross-platform application that lets you easily share files, folders and text between devices.
It uses the Go implementation of magic-wormhole, called [wormhole-william](https://github.com/psanford/wormhole-william), and compiles statically into a single binary.
Rymdport is also compatible with sending to and receiving from other wormhole clients, such as the cli applications [wormhole-william](https://github.com/psanford/wormhole-william) and [magic-wormhole](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole).
