Forage simplifies interacting with shopping lists on your Mealie instance. It runs on Linux, Android, Darwin, Windows, iOS, and FreeBSD (builds are provided for the first four), and presents a native Fyne alternative to the Mealie web interface. You can create shopping lists, add items, and toggle items' checked status.
