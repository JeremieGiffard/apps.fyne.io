Nomad is a time converion app that helps to manage time
across multiple timezones and locations.
It takes a graphical approach to illustrating locations using Unsplash images loaded dynamically.

The UI was designed to bring a custom brand to a Fyne app so the team could show how easily this could be implemented.
